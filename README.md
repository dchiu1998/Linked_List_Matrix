# Linked_List_Matrix
A matrix project designed using linked lists. Includes matrix operations to manipulated matrix objects and exceptions.

A Matrix object is implemented in such that only a single node is declared at its creation
(i.e. a matrix with dimensions 5000x5000 will only have one single node, its head, at time of declaration). There 
is a default value which is the value for every element of the matrix which does not have any value set yet. 
This allows us to save space when working with extemely large matrices.

For example, consider the following example:
